    Initializes a simple linear model with a defined input size and a specific number of output classes,

    This function creates a sequential model consisting of a flattening layer and two linear layers,
    designed to handle input images of a fixed size (224x224 pixels). It also sets up a series of 
    transformations to properly preprocess the input images for the model.

    Parameters:
    num_classes (int): The number of output classes for the final linear layer. Default is 101.
    seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 31.
    freeze_gradients (bool): If True, freezes the gradients of the model's parameters. Even though this

                             are unfrozen by default. Default is False.
    unfreeze_blocks (int): Currently unused in the function. Reserved for potential future functionality

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - model (torch.nn.Module): A sequential model with a series of linear transformations.
        - transform (callable): A transformation function for input image preprocessing, including resizing, 
                                normalization, and conversion to tensor format.

    Example:
    ```python
    model, transform = linear(num_classes=100, seed=42)
    ```

    Notes:
    - The function sets a random seed to ensure reproducibility of the initialization process.
    - The model expects input images of size 224x224 pixels, which are flattened into vectors of size 150528.
    - Normalization constants in the transform are standard values used with models pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
    - The `freeze_gradients` and `unfreeze_blocks` parameters are placeholders for potential future enhancements and do not
      currently affect the behavior of the function.

    Initializes and returns a simplified VGG-like model with fewer and smaller convolutional layers, tailored
    to a specific number of classes, and a transformation pipeline for image preprocessing.
    Architecutre from https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/

    This function constructs a small-scale convolutional neural network reminiscent of the VGG architecture,
    but significantly reduced in complexity and size. It's designed to process images resized to 224x224 pixels.
    The model features several convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max pooling, followed by a
    flattening layer and a linear classifier.

    Parameters:
    num_classes (int): The number of output classes for the final linear layer. Default is 101.
    seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility across different runs. Default is 31.
    freeze_gradients (bool): If True, freezes the gradients of the model's parameters to prevent them from
                             being updated during training. Default is False.
    unfreeze_blocks (int): This parameter is currently unused but included for potential future extensions
                           where specific blocks of the model might be selectively unfrozen.

    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing:
        - model (torch.nn.Module): A tiny VGG-like sequential model configured for classification with
                                   the specified number of classes.
        - transform (callable): A transformation function for preprocessing input images, including resizing,

    Example:
    ```python
    model, transform = tiny_vgg(num_classes=100, seed=42)
    ```

    Notes:
    - The transformation applied to input images includes resizing to 224x224 pixels, conversion to tensor,
      and normalization using mean and standard deviation values typical for models trained on the ImageNet dataset.
    - The model is designed to receive input tensors of shape (3, 224, 224), corresponding to 3-channel color images.
