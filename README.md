# Food Image Classifier (PyTorch ver.)
Machine learning model that classifies [101 types of Food.](https://github.com/RyanTietjen/Food-Classifier-pytorch-ver.-/blob/main/demo/class_names.txt)

You can find a demo of my model on my [HuggingFace.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/RyanTietjen/Food_Classification_PyTorch)

This model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 91.55% and a Top-5 accuracy of 98.56% by utilizing [this pretrain ViT](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models/generated/torchvision.models.vit_b_16.html#torchvision.models.ViT_B_16_Weights).
